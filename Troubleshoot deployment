A new deployment called alpha-mysql has been deployed in the alpha namespace. However, the pods are not running.
Troubleshoot and fix the issue. 
The deployment should make use of the persistent volume alpha-pv to be mounted at /var/lib/mysql and should use the environment variable MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=1 to make use of an empty root password.

Important: Do not alter the persistent volume.

Use the command kubectl describe and try to fix the issue.

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim

  name: mysql-alpha-pvc
  namespace: alpha
spec:
  accessModes:

Create a pod called secret-1401 in the admin1401 namespace using the busybox image. The container within the pod should be called secret-admin and should sleep for 4800 seconds.

The container should mount a read-only secret volume called secret-volume at the path /etc/secret-volume. The secret being mounted has already been created for you and is called dotfile-secret.
Here's an example YAML manifest for creating a pod called secret-1401 in the admin1401 namespace, 
using the busybox image, with a container called secret-admin that sleeps for 4800 seconds, 
and mounts a read-only secret volume called secret-volume at the path /etc/secret-volume:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: secret-1401
  namespace: admin1401
spec:
  containers:
  - name: secret-admin
    image: busybox
    command:
    - "sleep"
    - "4800"
    volumeMounts:
    - name: secret-volume
      mountPath: /etc/secret-volume
      readOnly: true
  volumes:
  - name: secret-volume
    secret:
      secretName: dotfile-secret
kubectl apply -f secret-1401.yaml

Create a new deployment called nginx-deploy, with image nginx:1.16 and 1 replica. Next upgrade the deployment to version 1.17 using rolling update.

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deploy
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.16
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
kubectl apply -f nginx-deploy.yaml
